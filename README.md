## Landscape

## NICE-Actimize is in Regulation Technology domain. Reg-tech is the management of regulatory processes within the financial industry through technology. The main functions of reg-tech include regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulatory Technology is a technology that allows firms to easily adapt to the pressure of increasing regulatory reporting, while being cost-effective and secure. This technology allows companies to automate the process of monitoring data. Regtech simplifies the process of regulatory requirements.

## Fin-Techs came onto the market after the 2008 global recession. They developed a new customer experience with low to no cost products, simple onboarding, convenience and a fully digital engagement.  Reg-Tech is a sub-class of Fin-Tech and has gained prominence since 2015.  Reg-techs, like fin-techs, made their name with trade finance applications. Their total market value is expected to reach $55 billion by 2025, at a compound annual growth rate of 53 percent. Corporations are expected to cut the cost of compliance and generate insight that can deliver additional value. The rising number of fraudulent activities has been a significant factor driving the growth. In addition, the increasing need for risk and compliance management has led to the increased adoption of regulatory technology (Reg-Tech) solutions. The implementation of these solutions helps reduce compliance costs and improve efficiency. It also speeds up business processes, enhances their ability, and reduces hassle for customers and the risk of compliance failures.

## Recommendations

## NICE-Actimize should offer an Open-Source version of their Capital Markets Compliance software.

## The following recommendations are based on actual interviews with users of Actimize from two different, large investment banks.

## Compliance analyst, who use the Actimize Capital Markets software are looking at alerts in order to see any insider trading activity with equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities. The alerts are based on certain parameters that are set up in reports. The issues that these users are facing on a daily basis are as follows:

- There is a lack of flexibility with reading trade inventory. With an Open-Source version, the in-house developers could increase customization. 
- When using the Global Search functionality, and looking up trade alerts, which could number in the thousands, there is no way to export these results into an excel file. It becomes a very tedious job to open up each alert.
-	Another recommendation is for Actimize to have the ability to create reports from their own software. Currently, these compliance reports are created upstream from internal or other vendor systems and fed into Actimize.
-	Alerts are generated because some limit on a stored procedure has been reached. The alerts are typically trades done by clients facilitated by a trading desk. Along with the trade there may be a telephone conversation between two traders that requires analyst review. Currently, Actimize does not integrate the alert timeline and voice recording, necessitating the analyst to toggle between applications.
-	There are many analysts that use Actimize within an investment bank. The analysts all are assigned an internal ID number to identify them. Actimize does not interface with the firm directory and automatically assign reports or alerts based on any ID number.
